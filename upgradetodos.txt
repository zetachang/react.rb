observable_spec.rb

native_library_spec.rb  <- no big interaction, just hooks into @@component_classes
  importing native react components (like bootstrap)


export_component_spec.rb <- completely stand alone 
  export_component
  

rendering_context_spec.rb
    NOTE: rendering context primarily exists so that we can say Foo::Bar in the dsl, because we have no way of knowing the caller, so we have to track it via RenderingContext
    NOTE: put the component lookup method in here I think
  components can be directly named in the dsl (i.e. if class Foo, then you can just say Foo)
  _as_node will return the native node without pushing into the buffer
  if element returned from the child block is a string it is added to the buffer
  test to make sure subclassing components works
  
exception_handling_spec.rb
  you don't have to have render method, if you just want to export state  <- not sure what is going on here, but there is a render method now in the component, that raises an error unless its subclassed
  catch and print rendering method if rendering fails.
    I'm figuring that there will more exception cases (like misnamed components) that can go in this file.

state_spec.rb
  states all get methods  - states define methods foo, foo= and foo!
  export / import states
  states can be defined from within components instances (i.e. before_mount)
  define_state extended syntax:  strings/symbols are initialized to the default initializer (nil or provided by block), the hash gives name => value pairs
  if default initializer excepts params then it is considered a state listener and will receive |state_name, current_value, new_value| on state changes
  

params_spec.rb
  NOTE: probably updates validator
  can require param on a single line: required_param or optional_param
  can require param of type Proc
  params get methods 
  proc params automatically call
  ReactObserver params interact with the observer


depends on react-source <- does it have to (i.e. perhaps for react-rails to work?, if not then do a separate PR at end)
