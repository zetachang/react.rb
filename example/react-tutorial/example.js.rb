  # Here we introduce optional parameter type checking.  The syntax [Hash] means "Array of Hashes"
  # In our case each comment is a hash with an author and text key.
  
  # Failure to match the type puts a warning on the console not an error, 
  # and only in development mode not production.
  
  required_param :comments, type: Array 
  
  # This is a good place to think more about the component lifecycle.  The first time 
  # CommentList is mounted, comments will be the initial array of author, text hashes.
  # As new comments are added the component will receive new params.  However the component
  # does NOT reinitialize its state.  If changes in state are needed as result of incoming param changes
  # the before_receive_props call back can be used.

  def render
    
    # Lets render some comments - all we need to do is iterate over the comments array using the usual 
    # ruby "each" method.  
    
    # This is a good place to clarify how the DSL works.  Notice that we use comments.each NOT comments.collect
    # When a tag method (such as div, or Comment) is called its "output" is internally pushed into a render buffer.
    # This simplifies the DSL by separating the control flow from the output, but can sometimes be a bit confusing.

      comments.each do |comment|

  # While declaring the type of a param is optional its handy not only for debug, but also to let React create
  # appropriate helpers based on the type.  In this case we are passing in a Proc, and so React will treat the
  # "submit_comment" param specially.  Instead of submit_comment returning its value (as the previous params have done)
  # it will call the associated Proc, thus allow CommentForm to communicate state changes back to the parent.
  
  required_param :submit_comment, type: Proc

        # author is what will cause us to re-render and update the input as the value of author changes.

      # This is usually the desired behavior in React as we are typically interested in state changes,
