**React.rb is an [Opal Ruby](http://opalrb.org) wrapper of [React.js library](http://facebook.github.io/react/)**.

It lets you write reactive UI components, with Ruby's elegance and compiled to run in JavaScript. :heart:

## Installation

Currently this branch (0.8 in catprint labs) is being used with the following configuration.  
It is suggested to begin with this
set of gems which is known to work and then add / remove them as needed.  Let us know if you discover anything.

Currently we are using rails 3.x

```ruby
# Gemfile
# gem 'react-rails', git: "https://github.com/catprintlabs/react-rails.git" # include if you want integration with rails
gem 'opal'

# gem 'opal', git: "https://github.com/catprintlabs/opal.git"  # use this if you are stuck on rails 3.x
# gem 'opal-jquery', git: "https://github.com/catprintlabs/opal-jquery.git" # same as above

# include if you want integration with rails
# gem 'opal-rails' 

# while not absolutely necessary you will probably want this at least for timers and such
# gem 'opal-browser'

gem 'opal-react', git: "https://github.com/catprintlabs/react.rb.git", :branch => 'opal-0.8'

# access active record models from opal!
# gem 'reactive_record', git: "https://github.com/catprintlabs/reactive-record.git"  

# include if you want to use bootstrap
# gem 'react-bootstrap-rails' 
```

and in your Opal application,

```ruby
require "opal-react"
require "react"

React.render(React.create_element('h1'){ "Hello World!" }, `document.body`)
```

For a complete example covering most key features, as well as integration with a server (Sinatra, etc), see setup of [Examples](example/tutorial).  For additional information on integrating Opal with a server see the [official docs](http://opalrb.org/docs/) of Opal.

## React Overview

### Basics

The biggest problem with react is that its almost too simple.

In react you define components.  Components are simply classes that have a "render" method.   The render method "draws" a chunk of
HTML.  

Here is a very simple component:

```ruby

require 'opal'
require 'opal-react'

class Hello
  def render
    "hello world"
  end
end
```

Include the `React::Component` mixin in a class to turn it into a react component

```ruby
require 'opal'
require 'opal-react'

class HelloMessage

  include React::Component                    # will create a new component named HelloMessage
  
  MSG = {great: 'Cool!', bad: 'Cheer up!'}

  optional_param :mood
  required_param :name
  define_state   :foo, "Default greeting"

  before_mount do                             # you can define life cycle callbacks inline
    foo! "#{name}: #{MSG[mood]}" if mood      # change the state of foo using foo!, read the state using foo
  end

  after_mount :log                            # you can also define life cycle callbacks by reference to a method

  def log
    puts "mounted!"
  end
  
  def render                                  # render method MUST return just one component  
    div do                                    # basic dsl syntax component_name(options) { ...children... }                                    
      span { "#{foo} #{name}!" }              # all html5 components are defined with lower case text
    end
  end
end

class App
  include React::Component

  def render
    HelloMessage name: 'John', mood: :great   # new components are accessed via the class name
  end
end

# later we will talk about nicer ways to do this:  For now wait till doc is loaded
# then tell React to create an "App" and render it into the document body.

`window.onload = #{lambda {React.render(React.create_element(App), `document.body`)}}`

# -> console says: mounted!
```

* Callback of life cycle could be created through helpers `before_mount`, `after_mount`, etc
* `this.props` is accessed through method `self.params`
* Use helper method `define_state` to create setter & getter of `this.state` for you
* For the detailed mapping to the original API, see [this issue](https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb/issues/2) for reference. Complete reference will come soon.

### Element Building DSL

As a replacement of JSX, include `React::Component` and you can build `React.Element` hierarchy without all the `React.create_element` noises.

```ruby
def render
  div do
    h1 { "Title" }
    h2 { "subtitle"}
    div(class_name: 'fancy', id: 'foo') { span { "some text #{interpolation}"} }
    present FancyElement, fancy_props: '10'
  end
end
```

### Props validation

How about props validation? Inspired by [Grape API](https://github.com/intridea/grape), props validation rule could be created easily through `params` class method as below,

```ruby
class App
  include React::Component

  params do
    requires :username, type: String
    requires :enum, values: ['foo', 'bar', 'awesome']
    requires :payload, type: Todo # yeah, a plain Ruby class
    optional :filters, type: Array[String]
    optional :flash_message, type: String, default: 'Welcome!' # no need to feed through `getDefaultProps`
  end

  def render
    div
  end
end
```

### Mixins

Simply create a Ruby module to encapsulate the behavior. Example below is modified from the original [React.js Exmaple on Mixin](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#mixins). [Opal Browser](https://github.com/opal/opal-browser) syntax are used here to make it cleaner.

```ruby
module SetInterval
  def self.included(base)
    base.class_eval do
      before_mount { @interval = [] }
      before_unmount do
        # abort associated timer of a component right before unmount
        @interval.each { |i| i.abort }
      end
    end
  end

  def set_interval(seconds, &block)
    @interval << $window.every(seconds, &block)
  end
end

class TickTock
  include React::Component
  include SetInterval

  define_state(:seconds) { 0 }

  before_mount do
    set_interval(1) { self.seconds = self.seconds + 1 }
    set_interval(1) { puts "Tick!" }
  end

  def render
    span do
      "React has been running for: #{self.seconds}"
    end
  end
end

React.render(React.create_element(TickTock), $document.body.to_n)

$window.after(5) do
  React.unmount_component_at_node($document.body.to_n)
end

# => Tick!
# => ... for 5 times then stop ticking after 5 seconds
```


### A Simple Component

A ruby class which define method `render` is a valid component.

```ruby
class HelloMessage
  def render
    React.create_element("div") { "Hello World!" }
  end
end

puts React.render_to_static_markup(React.create_element(HelloMessage))

# => '<div>Hello World!</div>'
```

### More complicated one

To hook into native ReactComponent life cycle, the native `this` will be passed to the class's initializer. And all corresponding life cycle methods (`componentDidMount`, etc) will be invoked on the instance using the snake-case method name.

```ruby
class HelloMessage
  def initialize(native)
    @native = Native(native)
  end

  def component_will_mount
    puts "will mount!"
  end

  def render
    React.create_element("div") { "Hello #{@native[:props][:name]}!" }
  end
end

puts React.render_to_static_markup(React.create_element(HelloMessage, name: 'John'))

# => will_mount!
# => '<div>Hello John!</div>'
```
## Example

* React Tutorial: see [example/react-tutorial](example/react-tutorial), the original CommentBox example.
* TodoMVC: see [example/todos](example/todos), your beloved TodoMVC <3.

## TODOS

* Documentation
* API wrapping coverage of the original js library (pretty close though)
* React Native?

## Developing

To run the test case of the project yourself.

1. `git clone` the project
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rackup`
4. Open `http://localhost:9292` to run the spec
